    <h3>Electrical & Electronics Engineer. Web Developer. Digital Marketer</h3>
    <p>Hi, there I am an Electrical & Electronics Engineer. Who have lots of passion and dream to contribute in sustainable and clean energy. Also my hobby is to create my own robotics company where I will create AI robots for our day to day life. Right now I am learning web developing to create my own tech website or to earn some extra money. To boom in my own business I have also learnt Digital Marketing. By this skills I can reach my products to every corner of the world through google, facebook, youtube, email, instagram marketing. I have intention to persue my MSc in Europe. For that reason I am working on some reasearch papers so that it is easier for me to get a full free scholarship. Right now I am also doing my intern. After my 2/3 month of intern is finished I will apply for jobs in different factories and industries as a EEE engineer. And also try to complete my IELTS. Then I will start applying for scholarships. Hope Allah gives me a good and bright and peaceful future. </p>
