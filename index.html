            <h1>Project</h1>
            <h2>Non-Lethal Weaponized Drone for Women Safety</h2>
            <p>This drone was developed for the safety of women. Bnagladesh has a higher rate of rape. Almost everyday there are almost 2-3 cases of rape happening all around the country. So we have designed a Wearable Device which can send signal in case the women find herself in a emergency situation. Then the police can fly this drone to the location of the women. This drone is equiped with dirt gun and pepper spray. Also to target precisely two lazer pointer is used. There is a loud speaker attached with it so that police can notify the people close by.</p>
